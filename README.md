 PROJECT:TEMPERATURE CONVERTER ,a program that converts temperatures between Celsius, Fahrenheit, and Kelvin. The program should allow the user to input a temperature in one scale and output the converted temperature in another scale.

PROJECT OVERVIEW:

Objective:                            

The objective of this project is to create a program in C that allows the user to convert temperatures between Celsius, Fahrenheit, and Kelvin scales. The program should handle input from the user, perform the conversion based on the chosen scales, and output the converted temperature.

KEY ACTIVITIES:                                           

Input Handling: Receive input from the user for the temperature value and the initial scale.                                
Conversion Logic: Implement formulas to convert temperatures between Celsius, Fahrenheit, and Kelvin scales.                                
Output: Display the converted temperature to the user.                                              
Error Handling: Validate user input to ensure it's within valid temperature ranges and handle any errors gracefully.  

TECHNOLOGIES USED:                             

C Programming Language: Used for coding the temperature conversion logic.                                        
Standard Input/Output Functions: printf, scanf for displaying content and accepting user input.                                             
Arithmetic Operations: Basic arithmetic operations to perform temperature conversions using conversion formulas.                                         
Control Structures: if-else statements for condition checks and decision-making.                                                         
Error Handling: scanf return value and basic conditional checks to handle invalid inputs.         

KEY INSIGHTS:

User Interface: Provide clear instructions and messages to guide the user through the conversion process.                                          
Data Validation: Ensure input validation to handle non-numeric inputs or out-of-range temperatures.                                                  
Flexibility: Allow for easy expansion or modification of the program to include additional temperature scales or units.                              
Modularity: Functions are used to encapsulate each conversion process, promoting code reusability and readability.                                          
Precision: Temperature values are formatted to two decimal places for clarity in output.                                                               
User-Friendly Interface: Provides clear prompts and formatted output for easy understanding.                                                                   
Error Handling: Basic input validation is performed within scanf statements to prevent crashes or incorrect conversions due to unexpected inputs.                                                          


This program serves as a foundational example of temperature conversion in C, demonstrating fundamental principles of function-based programming, arithmetic operations, and user input/output handling.
